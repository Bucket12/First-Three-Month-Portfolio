# First Three Month Portfolio.

## Description
This application is used to display works created by myself in an organized fashion. At the top right of the application we have a navigation menu which can be used to quickly access the About Me, My Works and Contact Me sections of the page. In my about me you can read about my goals as a student in Web Development. In the My Works section you will find tabs that can be used to access the different applications I have made so far. Finally, in the Contact Me section you will find a phone number, an email address and a link to my GitHub acount.
